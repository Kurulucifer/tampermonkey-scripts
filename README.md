## Scripts

ABOBA Exterminator replaces ABOBA's with wideKoko emotes. Only the (Randomizer) version is being updated now. Example: https://imgur.com/a/MndeQfi

wideKokoGacha just makes wideKokoGacha return a random wideKoko, just like ABOBA Exterminator but without having to write ABOBA. 

Feel free to suggest improvements to the scripts! I'm not too familiar with JavaScript/HTML/CSS and did a lot of Googling.

## Installation

Get Tampermonkey from the [official site](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) for your browser. 

Click the extension icon and create a new script. 

Copy and paste the script code from here and save. 

These scripts auto-enable only on [Zy0xxx](https://www.twitch.tv/zy0xxx) Twitch streams. If you want to enable this for other channels,  copy and paste the  "// @match" line with the appropriate channel link (plus the asterisk so VOD chats are included). If you want to enable this globally across twitch, change the "// @match" line to just "https://www.twitch.tv/*". Make sure the indentation is consistent with the other lines!

## Known Issues

- Using wideKokoGacha multiple times in a text-only message only shows one wideKokoGacha.
- wideKokoGacha does not have any spacing between it and adjacent text/emotes. 

## Changelog

11/24/23 - ABOZO added to the filter list.
